# Spice

Spice is a state of the art clock-based spiking neural network simulator. The accompanying paper ["Faster and Simpler SNN Simulation with Work Queues"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07423) has been recently accepted at IJCNN 2020.

## WIP
The repository is still work in progress: We're continually improving the code and documentation. Be patient and stay tuned.

## Requirements
- CUDA SDK 8.0 or higher
- nVidia GPU with compute capability 6.1
- CMAKE 3.0.2 or higher, recommended default settings, builds out of the box.
